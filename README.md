# Tank-Bot

This repository contains the code used to run our Tank Bot. We run this robot in the Memorial Day parade, in football games, and in other events. The code was made in Robot C, which is what the old Vex EDR brains use.

Tank Bot consists of a rotating turret with a pneumatic piston that can launch t-shirts into crowds of people. There's also a piston to adjust the pitch of the tank's barrel. The turret is controlled by the right joystick and the pitch is controlled by the right trigger buttons. NOTE: At the moment, Tank Bot is mounted to another chassis, so there is no drivetrain code.
